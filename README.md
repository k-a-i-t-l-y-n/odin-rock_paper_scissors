# odin-rock_paper_scissors
This project is a simulation of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
The focus is on creating JavaScript functions and calling them appropriately to
play the game correctly.

The two players of the game are the computer and the user. 
The user is prompted to input its choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer randomly chooses one of those options. 
Their respective choices then determine the outcome of the round.
There are five rounds in each game.
